# Map & Route Planner

This repository contains code to find the shortest path between two cities or two places within a city of Pakistan.

## Objective

The project focused on the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm and finding the shortest distance between two points.\
After completing the implementation, we further optimized the code by changing the data structures to hashmaps for least time cost.

### To Run

The project was built on Qt framework for C++. Copy the src files to a project in Qt and run to get the GUI.
