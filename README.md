# Map & Route Planner

This repository contains code to find the shortest path between two cities or two places within a city of Pakistan.

## Summary

The project focused on the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm and finding the shortest distance between two points.\
After completing the implementation, we further optimized the code by changing the data structures to hashmaps for least time cost.
